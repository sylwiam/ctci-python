""" 1.9 String Rotation: Assume yu have a method isSubsstring which check is one word is a substring of another. 
Given two strings, s1 and s2, werite code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring
(e.g. 'waterbottle' is  arotation of "erbottlewat)

Solution: Concatenate two rotated strings, you'lll see that no matter how you rotate a string, 
the original word is always inside the concatenated one:
"erbottlewat" + "erbottlewat" = "erbottlewaterbottlewat" ("erbottleWATERBOTTLEwat")
