## Solutions to "Cracking the Coding Interview" book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

This project is a collection of answers to problems from the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book.
I wanted to dig into python algorithms and data strcutures so I started solving questions from that book.

Please note that not all of the problems from the book were solved, and some solutions may not be 100% correct. This was just practice for me.
