""" 1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, 
write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Ca you do this in place?

time complexity: n^2, where n is the firs n of matrix definition, 
2 for loops looping through the entire input matrix for each elemeent

Basically, what happens is you got down each row, but backwards on items in each row
